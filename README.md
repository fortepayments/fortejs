=======

Securely capture payment information while maintaining complete control of your payment form and UX with Forte.js. Adding Forte.js to your HTTPS-hosted site reduces your PCI exposure by posting sensitive customer information directly to Forte's servers instead of your own. Forte.js also simplifies your payment processing by ensuring you don't have to worry about the complex security implications that arise when credit card or echeck data hits your server. Instead, after receiving a customer POST, Forte returns a single-use token to you, which you can use to create a transaction.
